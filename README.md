# CodeQuiz
A timed Code Quiz
The application presents users with a quiz on JavaScript concepts.
When the user clicks the Start button, a timer starts counting down from 60 seconds, and a question with possible answers is displayed.
When the user clicks on an answer, if the answer is wrong, the counter will be reduced by 10 seconds.
The next question and list of answers will then be displayed.
The questions will be randomly chosen from an array of potential questions.
Once the questions are done, the app will ask the user to enter their initials. 
Their initials will then be displayed along with the time left when they finished the quiz, in a list of other initials and scores stored in the local storage.
They can then go back to the start of the quiz or clear the high score list.
There is a button in the upper left corner that immediately displays the high score list.
